# Sunflower Glass: Stained Glass Studio
### sunflowerglass.com

We create a wide range of Tiffany-Style Stained Glass works of art. Our overall design ranges from Traditional to Contemporary and we use only the highest quality domestic and import stained glasses. Our location, snuggled in the Wayne National Forest in Southeastern Ohio, affords us ample inspiration to create a wide variety of original works ranging from small gift-size production pieces, larger commissioned work, to one-of-a-kind custom works of art. We design our works, not only for the spaces they will occupy, but also for the people that live or work in that space.

Our business has been near Amesville, Ohio since our inception in 1980. In 1996 we suffered a loss of our complete studio to fire. We rebuilt and have continued to produce stained glass art, surrounded by nature, in our new studio. Our goal is to _"Produce work that givesthe viewer a sense of harmony and rightness"_ (John Matz).

The Tiffany style refers to how the stained glass is put together. The edges of each piece of stained glass are wrapped with copper. The pieces are then bonded together, copper edge to copper edge. Tiffany style is also commonly called Leaded Stained Glass due to the solder used to bond the pieces together.  Because of this, many of our measurements are approximated to give an idea of size. Exact sizing and inquiries into commissioned works and custom orders should be sent to john@sunflowerglass.comor you can call **(740)448-3955**. Studio hours are byappointment only.
