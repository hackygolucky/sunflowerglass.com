			<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We create a wide range of
			Tiffany-Style Stained Glass works of art.&nbsp; Our overall design
			ranges from Traditional to Contemporary and we use only the highest
			quality domestic and import stained glasses.&nbsp; Our location,
			snuggled in the Wayne National Forest in Southeastern Ohio, affords
			us ample inspiration to create a wide variety of original works
			ranging from small gift-size production pieces, larger commissioned
			work, to one-of-a-kind custom works of art.&nbsp;&nbsp; I design my
			works, not only for the spaces they will occupy, but also for the
			people that live or work in that space.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our business has been
			near Amesville, Ohio since our inception in 1980.&nbsp; In 1996 we
			suffered a loss of our complete studio to fire.&nbsp; We rebuilt and
			have continued to produce stained glass art, surrounded by nature,
			in our new studio.&nbsp; Our goal is to <i>&quot;Produce work that gives
			the viewer a sense of harmony and rightness&quot;</i> (John Matz). </font>&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tiffany style refers
			to how the stained glass is put together.&nbsp; The edges of each
			piece of stained glass are wrapped with copper.&nbsp; The pieces are
			then bonded together, copper edge to copper edge.&nbsp; Tiffany
			style is also commonly called Leaded Stained Glass due to the solder
			used to bond the pieces together. &nbsp; Because of
			this, many of our measurements are approximated to give an idea of
			size.&nbsp; Exact sizing and inquiries into commissioned works&nbsp;
			and custom orders should be sent to
			<a href="mailto:john@sunflowerglass.com">john@sunflowerglass.com</a>
			or you can call <b>(740)448-3955</b>.&nbsp; Studio hours are by

			It's lovely here, and there's no season that I don't enjoy.</font></i></p>
			<p><i><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My background is in

			burned out.&nbsp; I had always liked stained glass, but I didn't
			have a background in art.&nbsp; So I took an eight-week night school
			class, quit my job and started doing stained glass.&nbsp; That was
			in 1980.&nbsp; I haven't looked back and have no regrets.</font></i></p>
